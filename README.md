# Rails API for mobile app

This repo contains the api that is being used by [this](https://github.com/shairyar/ionic-with-login-signup) ionic app.

## Installation

```sh
bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
foreman start
```
Rails [JumpStart](https://github.com/excid3/jumpstart) template was used to create the rails app. All it does is allows user to login/signup.
